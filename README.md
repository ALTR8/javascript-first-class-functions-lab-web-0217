Functions Returning Functions Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice writing functions that return other functions
2. Practice passing a function to another function
3. Practice calling a function returned by another function

## Introduction

- Frame the narrative of the lab (some real-life analogy to partials/first-class functions/dynamic jobs)
- Re-introduce first-class functions
- Walk students through writing out a function or two (partial function application is always a good exercise here)

## Tests

- Build tests up incrementally -- the first test should be relatively straightforward
- Tests can be about manipulating objects, etc., as long as they test students' ability to use first-class functions
